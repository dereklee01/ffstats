# FFSTATS

### Welcome to ffstats by Derek Lee.

This Python application was developed in order to be able to go back in history and find the best performing fantasy football teams for any week, year, and league scoring type (standard or PPR). Using BeautifulSoup, requests, and pandas, this code was written.

### How the Code Works
When first run, the user will have to input information regarding the desired week, year, league scoring type, and the number of specific positions for the desired fantasy football historical superteam. This information is then web scraped and the desired results are printed out to the console.
